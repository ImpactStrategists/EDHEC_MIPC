# Plan

## Preface

This plan is mainly about what the optimal/perfect outcome I want to achieve.

## Prerequisites

**Read all past cases & 1st place proposals**

## Presentation format:

**Make a shiny App for the presentation.**

Benefits:  
- **dynamically** present the result
- easy for simulation of different **situations**.

Disadvantage:
- require 10 Hours work

## Some thoughts

## Some problems should be considered before the work

- What are main metrics/performance measure/key indicators for your portfolio strategy? (e.x. ESG score, Co2 emission)

- How to visualize result? (using plotly package)

- How to take account the impact of covid-19 into your model?

- If possible, how to combine some machine learning technology into the portfolio optimization?

- what are the sources of risk involved in portfolio?

- How to sort things in a long term frame

- Although the case is fictional, but could we find some real counterpart in life to use our strategy (for pragmatic objective )

- Simulation method

- Could we use smart beta in our portfolio?
or event-driven investment method?
